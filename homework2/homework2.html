        <h2> 自傳</h2>
        <p>My name is min­tzu Jhong. I was born in Tainan in 1993 and grew up in a warm and comfortable family.My father is a decorator; my mother is engaged in the textile industry as well as being a housewife.Seeing my parents work so hard, it made me study harder ; hope to it would reduce the family burden.In our home, family values are very democratic. Parents always respect what we want and our interests. So they did not interfere too much. Furthermore, the independence makes me more self­discipline.</p>
        <p> I was admitted to the National Tainan Junior College of Nursing for five years. Leaving my countryside home to live in a busy and unfamiliar city taught me autonomy and self­reliance. In order to adapt to the new environment quickly, I took the initiative to be a class representative, built up the class solidarity, and arranged activities in the spare time to promote classmate friendship.When I was in the third grade, I took over the presidency of the Food Research Society. Being a newly­established club in only its second year, there was little information and few activities. However, I organized the records and held voting activities for the best dishes.I was also the leader in elementary winter camp coordinated with the Ministry of Education and the National Youth Commission. I learned the spirit of service and strengthened my leadership abilities.</p>
        <p> During the five years at junior college my mind opened ever wider and I developed resilience. Plus, I learned all kinds of theoretical knowledge and nursing techniques. It has proved to be a turning­point which made me more mature in my life.
        </p>
        <p> I wish to assure you that, if successful, I would endeavor to give you every satisfaction. </p>
